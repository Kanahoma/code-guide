# Quick Start - Contribution

It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

``` bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

## Preview the site locally

Run the local server with `docsify serve`.

```bash
docsify serve ./docs
```

You will see below output on terminal

```text
Serving C:\Users\your_folder\documentation now.
Listening at http://localhost:3000
```

Now you can access your site at `http://localhost:3000`
