# Preparing a Pull Request

- Try to keep the pull requests small. A pull request should try its very best to address only a single concern.
- If you plan to do further work after the PR has been submitted, please use the Draft PR feature.
- Document your reasoning behind the changes. Explain why you wrote the code in the way you did. The code should explain what it does.
- If there's an existing issue related to the pull request, reference to it by adding something like `References/Closes/Fixes/Resolves #305`, where `305` is the issue number. More info [here](https://github.blog/2013-05-14-closing-issues-via-pull-requests/).
- Please fill out the PR Template when making a PR.
- Use Reviewers section to request for reviews.
- Add labels to your PR.
- All commits in a pull request will be squashed when merged, but when your PR is approved and passes our CI, it will eventually be live on production!
