# Local Development

Developing code, debugging code, and performing minor testing can be more convenient on a local development environment than a remote repository. To create a local environment that most closely replicates our remote environments, WPVIP recommends the VIP Local Development Environment feature built into VIP-CLI but there are other wayd to set up a local development site.

It is strongly recommended that you read the [Local development article](https://docs.wpvip.com/how-tos/local-development/) in the WPVIP documentation.

## Local Environment Setup

!> It's important to note that certain websites have multisite installations. When setting up a local environment, this is crucial to indicate because WordPress handles multisites differently behind the scenes.

For more information, please read the [VPVIP Multisite doc](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/multisites/).
