# Tools

The following tools are used at Kanahoma. This list is subject to change and expansion over time and is not intended to be all-encompassing. In general, we advise or mandate the use of these tools over others. Rules governing the inclusion of tools in a client site package are much more stringent than those employed in-house projects.

## Task Runners
[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - Gulp is a task runner build on Node that offers a similar suite of plugins and solutions to Grunt. The biggest difference is Gulp allows you direct access to the stream of information from your source files and allows you to modify this data directly.

[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - Webpack is a bundler for JS/CSS. Itâ€™s extremely useful when building larger JavaScript applications (i.e. React.js).
