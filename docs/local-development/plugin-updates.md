# WordPress Plugin Updates Workflow

This document outlines the workflow for updating 3rd party WordPress plugins using Dependabot and Composer.

## Using Dependabot and Composer

Dependabot and Composer are used for automated dependency management and updates in our WordPress projects.

- **[Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core)**: Automates the process of checking for updates to dependencies and sending pull requests.
- **[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)**: Manages PHP dependencies in our WordPress project.

## Setting Up Dependabot

1. Ensure a `dependabot.yml` configuration file exists in the `/.github` folder at the root of the repository.
2. Configure the `dependabot.yml` file to specify the dependencies to monitor (e.g., `composer.json`), their location, and update frequency.

## Plugin Update Process

### 1. Receive Dependabot Alerts

1. Dependabot regularly checks for updates to dependencies specified in the `dependabot.yml` file.
2. Receive alerts from Dependabot for available plugin updates.

### 2. Review Dependabot Pull Requests

1. Check the pull requests created by Dependabot for plugin updates.
2. Review the changes proposed by Dependabot to ensure compatibility and security.
3. If necessary, manually intervene to resolve conflicts or adjust update settings in `dependabot.yml`.

### 3. Testing Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the WordPress project to your local machine.
2. **Run Composer Update**: Navigate to the project directory and run `composer update` to update the dependency locally.
3. **Test Plugins**: Test the updated plugin locally to ensure it works correctly and does not introduce errors or conflicts.
4. **Check for Errors**: Monitor error logs, debug any issues, and verify compatibility with existing functionality. There are a few things to keep in mind:
   - Check your browser's JavaScript console and see if there are any errors.
   - Use Query Monitor to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Test edge cases and specific functionalities affected by the plugin updates.
6. **Security Audit**: Check the changelog of the updated plugin for any security vulnerabilities or fixes. Ensure that the updated plugin does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.

### 4. Resolving Issues

1. If issues are encountered during testing, communicate with the rest of the team to discuss the problems and potential solutions.
2. Troubleshoot and resolve any issues locally before proceeding.
3. If necessary, revert to previous versions or temporarily disable problematic plugins.

### 5. Push Changes

1. Once satisfied with the updates and testing, commit the changes to the local repository.
2. Push the changes to the remote repository.

### 6. Deployment

1. Deploy the updates to the `develop` environment for further validation. Verify and test the plugin updates on `develop` to ensure everything works well even in a remote repository.
2. If everything is working as expected on `develop`, the updates will be incorporated into the upcoming code release.

## Conclusion

Following this workflow ensures that plugin updates are carefully reviewed, tested, and validated before deployment, minimizing the risk of introducing errors or conflicts into the project.
