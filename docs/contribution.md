## Running the documentation locally

It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

``` bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

## Preview the site locally

Run the local server with `docsify serve`.

```bash
docsify serve ./docs
```

You will see below output on terminal

```text
Serving C:\Users\your_folder\documentation now.
Listening at http://localhost:3000
```

Now you can access your site at `http://localhost:3000`

> **Note**
> For more use cases of docsify-cli, head over to the [docsify-cli documentation](https://docsify.js.org/).

## Useful links

The docs are a collection of [Markdown files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) that also utilize [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Language & Style

When you contribute to documentation, please refrain from trivializing terms, such as "just", "simply", "easy", "obvious", and "straightforward". We recommend reading [this blog post](https://jessitron.com/2020/06/26/just-dont/) to understand why we discourage the use of this type of language.

The site's documentation is informal, but contributions should be well-structured and free of errors. PRs may require changes before merging.
