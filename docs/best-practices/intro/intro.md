# Best Practices

## Goal

As a company, we work hard to deliver components and websites that produce excellent user experiences. We must standardize the tools we use and the processes we follow if we want to increase efficiency. We will be able to better grasp the inner workings of another project and develop superior solutions if we standardize our tools, frameworks, libraries, style, version control, and even languages.

We should follow these best practices in all their work. We at Kanahoma embrace creativity, thus our best practices are not intended to be exhaustive or prohibitive. The goal of this document is to offer a solid recommendation rather than a strict instruction. We hope that these best practices will have an impact on the community as well as Kanahomies.
