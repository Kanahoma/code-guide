# Accessible Content Checklist

Using this content checklist, you can improve the accessibility of the content and make it more available to everyone.

## Formatting

- [ ] Minimum font size **SHOULD** be no less than 16px
- [ ] Minimum line heights (Headings: 1.3; Body: 1.5)
- [ ] Underlining non-link text **SHOULD** be avoided
- [ ] Excessive *emphasis/italics* **SHOULD** be avoided
- [ ] Use semantically correct headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`) and not Normal text made larger or bold to look like a heading
- [ ] There should be one and only one `H1`` on the page. This the page, post or product title.
- [ ] Long strings of ALL CAPS text **SHOULD NOT** be used (CAPS do not make good headings, lengthy notices or warnings)
- [ ] Use semantically correct elements (eg, for Lists, utilize included list functionality as opposed to hyphens or asterisks to make it **look** like a list)
- [ ] Tables **MUST** have headings. Heading labels **CAN’T** change in the middle of the table by using bold text as this creates a semantically incorrect table

## Design

- [ ] [Color contrast](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/): Any colors used **MUST** meet minimum contrast requirements
  - [ ] Normal Text (12pt-18pt, standard weight): `4.5:1`
  - [ ] Large Text (14pt, or larger, and bold; or, 18pt or larger, standard weight): `3:1`
- [ ] Important information **MUST NOT** be conveyed through color alone

## Context

- [ ] Sensory instructions **MUST** be avoided (eg, “...at the top of this page…”)
- [ ] Link text **MUST** make sense out of context. A user would need to know where that link is going to take them from the link text alone
- [ ] If you’re directing people to the website via a printed document, the page **SHOULD** be specified
- [ ] If your post is intended to be used as a post and printed media (eg, a physical mailing list), the wording **MUST** be adapted to fit either media
- [ ] Acronyms **MUST** be defined on their first instance (on the website, acronyms **MUST** be defined on their first instance on every page they appear on)
- [ ] If a section references a download, the download **MUST** appear within/next to that section, NOT at the bottom of the page
- [ ] References to other parts of a page **SHOULD** have an anchor link/bookmark to that section (especially if it was significantly earlier in the document)

## Images

- [ ] Non-decorative images **MUST** have `alt` text
- [ ] Alt text **MUST** describe the purpose of the image to a non-sighted user
- [ ] Graphs and charts **MUST** have alt text AND supportive text describing the purpose, results, and significance of the graph
